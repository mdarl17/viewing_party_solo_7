        power trio pretty well describes itself -- it is a strange amalgam of interviews
        and some well-chosen (and some not so well-chosen) performance clips. Strangely
        enough, the best part of the documentary, from the standpoint of information,
        is the interview segment with Jack Bruce and lyricist Pete Brown describing
        their way of working, and Ginger Baker''s recollection of how \"Strange Brew\"
        came to be written out of another song altogether, \"Lawdy Mama.\"","popularity":0.999,"poster_path":"/ky6uPAT5J61o3EwkjCPZbsvopZ3.jpg","release_date":"1991-06-22","title":"Cream:
